jdfnsjnfjeor, command-line -p option for dotnet build command.

          > dotnet build -p:WebDriverPlatform=mac64
          The specifying "WebDriverPlatform" MSBuild property is the highest priority method to control which platform version of the chromedriver will be copied.

          If you run the following command on Windows OS,
          
          > dotnet build -r:ubuntu.18.04-x64 -p:WebDriverPlatform=mac64
          The driver file of macOS x64 version will be copied to the output folder.

          How to include the driver file into published files?
          "chromedriver(.exe)" isn't included in published files on default configuration. This behavior is by design.

          If you want to include "chromedriver(.exe)" into published files, please define _PUBLISH_CHROMEDRIVER compilation
